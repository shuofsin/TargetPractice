Arcade-style game made to get familiar with Love2d engine and learn Lua

## To-Do
- Add more ballon types
    - Support ballons
        - Speed boost
        - Sheilding  
            - this would be very hard (probably?) (well maybe not) (nothing is really hard just takes time)
    - Boss Ballon
        - Need to destory a certain amount per wave to kill? 
        - Sheilded by other ballons?
